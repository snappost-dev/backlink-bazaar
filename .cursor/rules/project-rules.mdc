-# PROJECT CONTEXT: BACKLINK BAZAAR (Snappost Exchange)

**Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, Shadcn/UI.
**Design System:**
- Radius: Aggressive rounded corners (`rounded-[2.5rem]`).
- Colors: Slate (Neutral), Indigo (Agency Brand), Blue (Publisher), Red (Admin).
- Icons: `lucide-react`.

**Architecture Rules:**
- **Role-Based:** Folders must follow `src/app/(dashboard)/[role]/...` structure.
- **Frontend-First:** Always scaffold UI with Mock Data (`src/lib/mock-data.ts`) before connecting DB.
- **Whitelabel:** Buyer interface is dynamic based on subdomain.

**Critical Constraints:**
- Never expose `base_price` to the client.
- Always use `uuid` for IDs.
- Animations: Use `animate-in fade-in zoom-in` for all modals/cards.--
